# Waveform12_troubleshooting

My repo to add as much possible info to (1) keep a personal record of things like my kernel paramaters/changes , audio hacks , graphics and generally the specs of the Linux box used .

(2) I'm hoping this info will be useful to the developers of Tracktion waveform and Linux users of Waveform alike.
